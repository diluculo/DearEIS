# Running the tests

Make sure that DearEIS is installed with the `--editable` tag from the root of the repository:

```
pip install --editable .
```

Execute the `run_tests.sh` script from within the `tests` folder.

The Jupyter notebook found in the `examples` folder in the root of the repository can also be used to verify that the API works as expected.
